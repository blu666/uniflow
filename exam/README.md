# Backend Interview README

Due to the strict window I was given and other commitments (travel, classes etc.), I could only spend a few hours on this project. I only completed Part 3 and 4 of this project. My background relates more to Machine Learning and Deep Learning applications. I have limited experience workin with Kubernetes and RESTful APIS, but I have strong work ethic and desire to learn. I believe I will be able to quickly learn on the job.

I enjoyed reading about cambioML and hope to have the opportunity to speak with you guys about potential opporunities!

## Part 4: Dockerize Application
Make sure Docker is installed on your computer and is up-to-date.

cd into the project folder

run "docker build -t uniflow-test ."

To run docker, run "docker run uniflow-test"
